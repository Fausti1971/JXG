# JXG
Java XG-Editor

Simple small Editor for XG-Devices close to Yamaha-XG-Specification 2.00 of April 2001.
By default the specs is reading by the following files in the JXG.jar/xml/ directory:
(defaults.xml = defaultvalues,
drums.xml = drumnames,
parameter.xml = parameterspecification,
device.xml = devicestructure,
tables.xml = tables for valuetranslation and
template.xml = configuration for editorwindows(future))
You can customize your device by copy (one or more of) these files in a folder (named as your device) beside the JXG.jar.
